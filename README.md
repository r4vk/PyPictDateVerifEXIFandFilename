# EXIF Date Comparison and Modification

This project consists of two Python scripts that work together to analyze and modify EXIF capture dates of JPEG files.

## Description

The project includes the following files:

1. `compare_exif_dates.py`: This script compares the EXIF capture dates extracted from the files with the dates derived from their filenames. It generates a CSV file (`output.csv`) that lists the files with inconsistent dates.
2. `modify_exif_dates.py`: This script reads the CSV file generated by `compare_exif_dates.py` and modifies the EXIF capture dates of the specified files based on the values in the third column of the CSV file.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
   - Python 3.x
   - ExifTool (command-line application for reading and writing EXIF metadata)

2. Clone this repository or download the script files (`compare_exif_dates.py` and `modify_exif_dates.py`) to your local machine.

3. Place the JPEG files you want to analyze and modify in the same directory as the script files.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script files.

5. Run the `compare_exif_dates.py` script:
   ```
   python3 compare_exif_dates.py
   ```

   - The script will traverse all the files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
   - It will compare the EXIF capture dates with the dates extracted from the filenames.
   - Any files with inconsistent dates will be listed in the generated `output.csv` file.

6. Review the `output.csv` file to see the files with inconsistent dates.

7. Run the `modify_exif_dates.py` script to modify the EXIF capture dates:
   ```
   python3 modify_exif_dates.py
   ```

   - The script will read the `output.csv` file and modify the EXIF capture dates of the specified files.
   - The modified files will be listed in the terminal.

8. Verify that the EXIF capture dates of the specified files have been successfully modified.

## Notes

- The `compare_exif_dates.py` script uses the `exiftool` command-line tool to extract the EXIF capture dates from the files. Ensure that `exiftool` is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
- The `compare_exif_dates.py` script uses a specific file name mask and date format to extract dates from the filenames. Modify the `mask` and `date_format` variables in the script according to your requirements.
- The `modify_exif_dates.py` script modifies the EXIF capture dates using the `exiftool` command-line tool. Make sure you have write permissions for the specified files.
- Both scripts are written in Python and can be executed on any operating system with Python and `exiftool` installed.
